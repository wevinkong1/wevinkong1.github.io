        <p>
            Hey guys, sorry for uploading the website really late. Anyways, now that you're here I minuswell explain the intentions that I have for the future of this website. Presently, I plan on using the website as a place for you guys to check right before coming to the meeting.<br><br>
            <b>What does this mean?</b><br> Well, this means that it will serve as an "announcement page" for you guys to visit so that you guys know what we're doing and our meeting plans. Additionally, every Friday, I will be updating the website so that it conforms to anything that may be planned over the course of our Boy Scout meeting. <br><br>
            <b>What will the website contain?</b><br>
            The website will contain future events such as camping trips, hiking trips, or any other type of <em><b><u>patrol related</u></b></em> outing. To elaborate, this website will not contain any information regarding service projects, troop meeting schedules, or troop outings. There is, however, an exception. If you tell me during the meeting or via <a href="mailto:kevinwong123@gmail.com">email</a> about something that you want to be announced on the website, then I will add it.
        </p>
